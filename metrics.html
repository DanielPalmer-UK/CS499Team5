<h1>Database Support Metrics</h1>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Estimated Story Points
</p>
<p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Import more vehicle data into existing database tables
</p>
<p>
This story will consist of transferring massive amounts of car data from CSV files into a database table that was created last spring. In order to do this we will need to either create a program to expedite the process or find some way to import the data in a timely manner.
  <p><u>20 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Add new tables into database aligned with what the mobile team adds to the app
</p>
<p>
This story is dependent on what the mobile teams are able to accomplish. We will be adding more tables into the AWS database in order to hold data for the new components added to the mobile app.
<p><u>25 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Write queries in order to allow app access to database
</p>
<p>
In order for the application to access the data, SQL queries will need to be written. This will most likely done in collaboration with one of the mobile teams.
<p><u>15 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Allow user to add personal data
</p>
<p>
This story will consist of multiple parts. The first part will be researching the best way to only allow the user access to their personal information. Next, queries will have to be written in order to insert the data into a table that will be created in user story number two. This story at this point is a stretch goal.
<p><u>25 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Database cleanup and maintenance
</p>
<p>
Throughout the project it will be a goal of our team to always make sure the database is not getting out of hand. A few ways this can be done is by writing efficient and effective queries as well as not creating an excessive number of tables.
<p><u>10 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Communication with other teams and customer
</p>
<p>
There are two mobile teams that we will be working with throughout the semester. Therefore, we will be having weekly meetings with both our customer and these other teams. It is very important that all the teams and customer are on the same page since it will directly impact the performance and efficiency of each team.
<p><u>10 points</u></p>
</p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Product Size
</p>
<p>
The current size of the project is approximately 105 story points. As a reference for how story points compare to time, the plan is that the first user story which is 20 story points will take roughly two weeks. At this point in time there are no acceptance test plans; however hopefully they will be developed down the road. 
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Product Effort
</p>
<p>
Each team member will work an estimated 10 hours a week on the project. Therefore, the team will put in 30 hours a week.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Defects
</p>
<p>
The project currently has no defects since it has not been officially started yet. Once defects are found this metric will be updated.
