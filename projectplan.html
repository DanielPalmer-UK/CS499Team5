<h1>Database Support Project Plan</h1>
<h2>User Stories:</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
1. Import more vehicle data into existing database tables
</p>
<p>
This story will consist of transferring massive amounts of car data from CSV files into a database table that was created last spring. In order to do this we will need to either create a program to expedite the process or find some way to import the data in a timely manner.
  <p><u>20 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
2. Add new tables into database aligned with what the mobile team adds to the app
</p>
<p>
This story is dependent on what the mobile teams are able to accomplish. We will be adding more tables into the AWS database in order to hold data for the new components added to the mobile app.
<p><u>25 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
3. Write queries in order to allow app access to database
</p>
<p>
In order for the application to access the data, SQL queries will need to be written. This will most likely done in collaboration with one of the mobile teams.
<p><u>15 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
4. Allow user to add personal data
</p>
<p>
This story will consist of multiple parts. The first part will be researching the best way to only allow the user access to their personal information. Next, queries will have to be written in order to insert the data into a table that will be created in user story number two. This story at this point is a stretch goal.
<p><u>25 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
5. Database cleanup and maintenance
</p>
<p>
Throughout the project it will be a goal of our team to always make sure the database is not getting out of hand. A few ways this can be done is by writing efficient and effective queries as well as not creating an excessive number of tables.
<p><u>10 points</u></p>
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
6. Communication with other teams and customer
</p>
<p>
There are two mobile teams that we will be working with throughout the semester. Therefore, we will be having weekly meetings with both our customer and these other teams. It is very important that all the teams and customer are on the same page since it will directly impact the performance and efficiency of each team.
<p><u>10 points</u></p>

<h2>Risk List</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
1. User Security | Priority: 4 (1 low â€¦ 5 critical)
</p>
<p>
Users login information and online data must be properly protected. Ways to protect user include password requirements, access levels, and inactivity logouts. On top of this, it must be ensured that user data does not get leaked, or that another user does not have access to another users information. 
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
2. Cost Risks | Priority: 2 
</p>
<p>
We must ensure that whatever data we add or whatever changes we make to the database it is recorded and that we notify our customer of the changes. Some cases when vehicle information is added, or when tables are created, it may charge the customer since a monthly fee is charged for the database he is hosting.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
3. Data Recovery | Priority: 3
</p>
<p>
During each user story and part of the project, it is important that all the data is backed up and safely stored. We need to make sure data storage/retrieval is effective and clean.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
4. Communication Risks | Priority: 4
</p>
<p>
During the course of the year, three groups will be working together on an application. It is important that all groups progress at the same speed, and that one does not get too far ahead, or else overall progress will be hindered. It is also important that each group know what the other groups are doing, so that their changes can be accounted for by the other groups. Weekly emails and meetings help overcome any communication barriers.
</p>

<h2>Schedule and Resource Allocation</h2>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
Meetings with Customer
</p>
<p>
We have established weekly meetings with our customer, Mike Flamm, to commence every Tuesday at 3:30 P.M. These meetings will be used to update him on our current project standings as well as to ask/answer questions regarding the direction and status of our project.

Team 5 will be getting together four times a week to allocate team time to get together and work on our project. We shall be meeting on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays.

<p style="font-weight:bold">
1. Import more vehicle data into existing database tables
</p>
<p>
On this step of the project we will be working through the weeks of Sept. 17 and Sept. 24.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
2. Add new tables into database aligned with what the mobile team adds to the app
</p>
<p>
On this step of the project we will be working through the weeks of Oct. 1 and Oct. 15.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
3. Write queries in order to allow app access to database
</p>
<p>
On this step of the project we will be working through the weeks of Oct. 22 and Oct. 29.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
4. Allow user to add personal data
</p>
<p>
On this step of the project we will be working through the weeks of Nov. 5 and Nov. 19.
</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold">
5. Database cleanup and maintenance
</p>
<p>
On this step of the project we will be working through the week of Nov. 26 until the end of the semester.
</p>
<p>
Allocating a minimum of two weeks to each step of this project should provide ample time to design, test, and fix each step as we move along. Should we finish a step early, we shall add the remaining time onto the next step to properly allocate our working manpower.
